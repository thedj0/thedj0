                <strong>SCOPE</strong>
<br>
<strong>[Issue Description]:</strong> Customer has a job running on his automation account, which uses a managed identity and tries to access keyvault, however, it is failing with 503 error.
<br>
<strong>[Business Impact]:</strong> Medium, customer is unable to use the key and complete authentication.
<br>
<strong>[Expected Outcome]:</strong> Customer should be able to complete the authentication successfully using a MI.
<br><br>

<strong>CASE SUMMARY</strong>
<br>
<strong>[Environment]:</strong> Azure key vault with key, Azure Automation account which has the job running, managed identity
<br>
<strong>[Troubleshooting]:</strong> We checked the error and could see a forbidden 503 gateway error. Upon checking the network settings of the keyvault, we could see that customer has set the option to enable requests only from certain IP addresses and this job's IP address was not whitelisted. Customer wanted to use Azure Private Link, rather than whitelisting. This is supported from keyvault end, but as per documentation, Automation account doesn't support outbound requests to Azure Private Link services such as keyvault. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/how-to/private-link-security#limitations">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/how-to/private-link-security#limitations</a> Alternately, we can use Hybrid Runbook worker. So, I have engaged Automation support team to help us on the workaround.
<br><br>

<strong>ACTION PLAN</strong>
<br>
<strong>Case Status:</strong> Troubleshooting.
<br>
<strong>Next Action:</strong> Raise a collab with Automation team and discuss on the workaround
<br>
<strong>Next Contact:</strong> 6th August.

<br><br>

<strong>SCOPE</strong>
<br>
<strong>Issue Description:</strong> Customer is receiving a 503 Forbidden error when trying to access a key in Azure Key Vault using a managed identity. The job runs from an Azure Automation account and fails consistently.
<br>
<strong>Business Impact:</strong> The inability to access the key in Azure Key Vault is preventing the customerâ€™s automated tasks from completing successfully, potentially leading to disruptions in critical business operations and workflow automation.
<br>
<strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> Resolution of the 503 Forbidden error, allowing the Azure Automation account to successfully access the key in Azure Key Vault using the managed identity, either through whitelisting the necessary IP addresses or implementing an alternative solution.
<br><br>

<strong>CASE SUMMARY</strong>
<br>
<strong>Environment:</strong>
<br>
Azure Key Vault: Configured with network settings to restrict access only to whitelisted IPs.
<br>
Azure Automation Account: Used to run jobs that require access to Azure Key Vault.
<br>
Managed Identity: Utilized for accessing the Azure Key Vault.
<br><br>

<strong>Troubleshooting:</strong>
<br>
Verified the error message received (503 Forbidden) when the job attempts to access Azure Key Vault.
<br>
Checked the network settings of Azure Key Vault and confirmed that only requests from whitelisted IP addresses are allowed.
<br>
Determined that the IP address of the Azure Automation account service was not whitelisted.
<br>
Customer wanted to use a different approach via Azure Private Link.
<br>
Reviewed Azure documentation and confirmed that Azure Automation accounts do not support outbound requests to Azure Private Link.
<br><br>

<strong>ACTION PLAN</strong>
<br>
<strong>Case Status:</strong> Troubleshooting
<br><br>

<strong>Next Action:</strong>
<br>
<strong>Whitelisting IP Addresses:</strong> Work with the customer to identify and whitelist the IP addresses used by the Azure Automation account. This can be done by adding the required IP addresses to the Azure Key Vault network settings.
<br>
<strong>Alternative Solution (Hybrid Runbook Worker):</strong> Collaborate with the Azure Automation team to implement a Hybrid Runbook Worker as a workaround. This will allow the job to run from a local or on-premises environment where network settings can be controlled more precisely.
<br>
Ensure that the Hybrid Runbook Worker has the necessary network access and permissions to interact with the Azure Key Vault.
<br><br>

<strong>Next Contact:</strong>
<br>
Scheduled follow-up with the customer within 24 hours to provide an update on the progress of IP whitelisting.
<br>
Additional contact to be scheduled upon confirmation from the Azure Automation team regarding the implementation of the Hybrid Runbook Worker.
<br><br>

<strong>Additional Notes:</strong>
<br>
A collaboration request has been raised with the Azure Automation team to assist with the Hybrid Runbook Worker workaround.
<br>
Documentation and steps for setting up the Hybrid Runbook Worker will be shared with the customer to ensure a smooth implementation process.
<br>
Continuous monitoring of the situation to ensure that the implemented solution resolves the issue without causing any additional disruptions.

<strong>SCOPE</strong>
<br>
<strong>Issue Description:</strong> The customer is encountering a 503 forbidden error when attempting to access a key in Azure Key Vault using a managed identity. This job is being executed from an Azure Automation account and is failing consistently.
<br>
<strong>Business Impact:</strong> The inability to access critical keys in Azure Key Vault is significantly impacting the customer's operations. This issue is causing potential downtime and disrupting essential services that rely on these keys for secure operations.
<br>
<strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> The customer expects to resolve the 503 forbidden error and gain seamless access to the keys in Azure Key Vault. This will ensure the smooth functioning of their operations without any interruptions.
<br><br>

<strong>CASE SUMMARY</strong>
<br>
<strong>Environment:</strong>
<br>
- Azure Automation Account: The job is being executed from an Azure Automation account.
<br>
- Azure Key Vault: The key that the customer is trying to access is stored in Azure Key Vault.
<br>
- Managed Identity: The job uses a managed identity to access the key in Azure Key Vault.
<br><br>

<strong>Troubleshooting:</strong>
<br>
- Initial Investigation: Upon initial investigation, it was identified that the IP address of the automation account service was not whitelisted in the Azure Key Vault network settings.
<br>
- Network Settings Verification: Verified that according to the Key Vault network settings, only requests originating from whitelisted IP addresses are allowed to access the Key Vault.
<br>
- Customer's Attempted Solution: The customer attempted to use Azure Private Link to resolve the issue. However, it was found that Azure Automation Account does not support outbound requests to Azure Private Link as per the official documentation.
<br>
- Collaboration with Azure Automation Team: A collaboration has been initiated with the Azure Automation team to explore the possibility of using a Hybrid Runbook Worker as a workaround for this issue.
<br><br>

<strong>ACTION PLAN</strong>
